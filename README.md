# Hebrews 3:4 And every house is built by someone, but God is 
> For every house has a builder, but the one who built everything is God.



# Psalm 127 1
> Of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain. In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat-- for he grants sleep to those he loves.
